## Profiles

Each character starts with its own Postal profile (settings).

If you want characters to share settings (including contact lists), create a new profile (for example, `Shared by Alts`) and switch each character to that profile.

## Mass Mailing

Postal does not support mass mailing (sending to more than one person at a time), and there are no plans to add that functionality.
